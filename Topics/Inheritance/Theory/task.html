Inheritance is indicated by the keyword extends and supports single inheritance, with a superclass potentially having multiple subclasses. However, constructors are not inherited; instead, the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass's constructor using the super() keyword.

Method parameters are a mechanism for passing values to a method. When a method is called, the values passed in parentheses are assigned to the corresponding parameters inside the method. This allows the method to use the passed values in its calculations or operations. Inheritance is a mechanism for creating a new class based on an existing one.

In the context of a company's activity, for example, a class hierarchy could include a base class with common data fields such as name, year of birth, and address. Derived classes could then add additional fields specific to their purpose, such as a contract number and status for a client class, or start date of work and salary for an employee class. In Java, a class can only inherit from one superclass, but a superclass can have multiple subclasses. It's important to note that constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass. When working with class hierarchies, you can refer to a subclass object in two ways: using a subclass reference or using a superclass reference. The latter allows you to refer to any subclass using a superclass reference variable.">class hierarchies</a> and reuse existing code.</p>

<p>When it comes to inheritance, there are several terms. A class <strong>derived</strong> from another class is called a <strong>subclass</strong> (it's also known as a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3585" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a derived class is a subclass that inherits all public and protected fields and methods from its superclass. | It can also add new fields and methods, and the inherited and added members can be used in the same way. A derived class is related to its superclass through a parent-child relationship, where the derived class is the child and the superclass is the parent. This relationship allows for polymorphism, where a derived class object can be referred to using a superclass reference variable, providing flexibility and reusability in object-oriented programming.">derived class</a></strong>, <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an extended class, also known as a derived class or a subclass, is a class that is derived from an existing class, known as the superclass or the base class. | This mechanism of inheritance allows the extended class to acquire the fields and methods of the superclass, enabling code reuse and convenient class hierarchy building.

A parent class can have multiple child classes, but a child class can only have one parent class due to Java's single inheritance feature. The parent class reference can be used to refer to an object of the subclass. To derive a new class from another, the keyword extends is used. The common syntax is shown below. It is important to note that Java does not support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single superclass. A class hierarchy can have multiple levels (a class can extend a class that extends a class), and a superclass can have more than one subclass.

<p>There are important points about inheritance in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Java doesn't support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single superclass;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a class hierarchy can have multiple levels (class <code class="language-java">C</code> can extend class <code class="language-java">B</code> that extends class <code class="language-java">A</code>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a superclass can have more than one subclass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A subclass inherits all public and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a protected field is a type of field that has protected access modifier. | This means that the field can be accessed within the same class, within the same package, and within the subclasses of the class, but it cannot be accessed from any other class outside of its package and not related through inheritance. This mechanism provides a way to encapsulate the implementation details of a class and control the data access, ensuring security and predictability of the code behavior.">protected fields</a> and methods from the superclass. A subclass can also add new fields and methods. The inherited and added members will be used in the same way.</p>
<p>A subclass doesn't inherit private fields and methods from the superclass. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these members can be used inside subclasses.</p>
<p>Constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass using the special keyword <code class="language-java">super</code>. This keyword is discussed in more detail in another topic.</p>
<p>If you'd like the base class members to be accessible from all subclasses but not from the outside code (excluding the same package), use the access modifier <code class="language-java">protected</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> represents the <strong>IS-A</strong> relationship. A base class represents the general and a subclass represents the particular or specific.</p>

<p>Let's consider a more graphic example. A telecommunication company serves clients. It has a small staff consisting only of managers and programmers. Let's consider a class hierarchy for people associated with the company's activities (including clients).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The class hierarchy for the telecommunication company</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the base class <code class="language-java">Person</code> has fields for storing common data: name, year of birth, and address;</p>

</ul>
<p>Let's see the code:</p>

<p>This hierarchy has two levels and five classes overall. All fields are <code class="language-java">protected</code> , which means they are visible to subclasses. Each class also has public <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, getters and setters are methods used to protect and hide data when creating a class. | A getter method returns the value of a field, while a setter method sets or updates the value. Private fields are hidden from the rest of the code and make public methods more brief and readable. Getters and setters promote data encapsulation, which increases security and control over the data, and promotes a more organized code structure. They can also increase code readability and maintainability by hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world. Additionally, getters and setters can contain more sophisticated logic, such as returning non-stored values or modifying the value of another field according to a change.">getters and setters</a>, but some are skipped in the code as these classes use the default <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a no-argument constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments and is used to initialize the instance variables of a class with their default values. | If a class does not define any constructor, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor.

<p>Let's create an object of the <code class="language-java">Programmer</code> class and fill the inherited fields using the inherited setters. To read the values of the fields, we can use inherited getters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Programmer p = new Programmer();

p.setName("John Elephant");
p.setYearOfBirth(1985);
p.setAddress("Some street, 15");
p.setStartDate(new Date());
p.setSalary(500_000L);
p.setProgrammingLanguages(new String[] { "Java", "Scala", "Kotlin" });

System.out.println(p.getSalary()); // 500000
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(p.getProgrammingLanguages())); // [Java, Scala, Kotlin]</code></pre>
<p>We also can create an instance of any class included in the considered hierarchy.</p>
<p>So,<strong> inheritance</strong> provides a powerful mechanism for <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3493" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, code reuse is the practice of reusing existing code in a program to avoid redundancy, reduce development time, and improve program readability. | This is typically achieved through the use of methods, which are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> allows you to build class hierarchies where subclasses (children) take some fields and methods of the superclass (parent). Such a hierarchy can have multiple levels, but every class can inherit only from a single superclass. A good class hierarchy helps to avoid code duplication and makes your program more modular. If a class should not have subclasses, it should be marked as <code class="language-java">final</code>.</p>
