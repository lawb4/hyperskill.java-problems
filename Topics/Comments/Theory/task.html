<h2>Comments</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Inside a Java program, you can write a special text that will be ignored by the Java compiler â€” known as the <strong>comment</strong>. Comments allow you to exclude code from the compilation process (disable it) or clarify a piece of code to yourself or other developers. In our materials, we use comments in the theory and practice lessons to explain how and why our code works.</p><p>The Java programming language supports three kinds of comments.</p><h5 id="end-of-line-comments">End-of-line comments</h5><p>The Java compiler ignores any text from <code class="language-java">//</code> to the end of the line.</p><pre><code class="language-java">class Program {

        // System.out.println("Hello, World");
        // It prints the string "Hello, Java"
        System.out.println("Hello, Java"); // Here can be any comment
